# Character-manager-js
Using JS best practices.

### This challenge is intended to help us use JS best practices.

#### By the end of this challenge, we should be able to : 

<ul>
<li>Read documentation and test a REST API</li>
<li>Use a REST API with HTTP requests</li>
<li>Create a typical asynchronous flow : send asynchronous (promises or async/await) requests to a remote server and process the results
</li>
<li>DOM manipulation: changing the DOM based on results of HTTP requests</li>
</ul>

This work was done along with Alejandro Montilla https://github.com/AlejoVE/AlejoVE.
